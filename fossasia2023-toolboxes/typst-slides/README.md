## Quickstart
```typ
#import "slides.typ": *

#show: slides.with(
    authors: "Names of author(s)",
    short-authors: "Shorter author for slide footer",
    title: "Title of the presentation",
    subtitle: "Subtitle of the presentation",
    short-title: "Shorter title for slide footer",
    date: "March 2023",
)

#new-section("My section name")

#slide(title: "A boring static slide")[
  Some boring static text.
]

#slide[
  A fancy dynamic slide without a title.
  More text.
  #only(2)[This appears later!]
]
```
As you can see, creating slides is as simple as using the `#slide` function.
(You do not need to care about stuff like `#new-section` or `#only` in the
beginning.)

This code produces these PDF pages:

There are also different
[themes](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/typst-slides/book/theme-gallery/index.html)
to choose from!
If you like, you can even
[create your own](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/typst-slides/book/themes.html#create-your-own-theme).

**âš  This template is in active development.
While I try to make sure that the `main`-branch always is in a usable state,
there are no compatibility guarantees!**
